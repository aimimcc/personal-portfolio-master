# Personal Portfolio Website

Website: https://aimimcconnell.co.uk/ is where it should live but it currently lives https://portfolio-website-delta-two.vercel.app/ on the Vercel server .. in the process of working this out...

## The Aim

Create a personal portfolio that I can use t showcase my work but also learn some React, Next and Typescript

## Technical Stuff

The technologies I used to code/build the project so far..

- React
- Typescript
- Next
- React Particles
- RWD
- SEO
- UI/UX Design
- UI/UX Animations
- CSS â€“ preprocessed with SASS
- Google Analitics
- Vercel
- Git

## Takeaways

I would like to update not to use next.js - I feel it is a bit limiting when trying to export for using on my own domain Vercel seemed to be the only option for hosting so I need to learn a bit more about that...

## To Do

- Add favicon images
- Work on mobile CSS for Skills Page and rotating cube
